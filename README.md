# EDI parser

An early project idea for work; wanted to create something to perform pre-processing of EDI orders -  regex might not be the right approach here as there's so much variation in syntax even within the same EDI standards that it's just too fragile...

Abandoned for the time being but commited in order to archive, in case I choose to continue with it.
